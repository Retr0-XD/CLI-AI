# Gemini API Fix and Command Parsing Enhancement

## Problem Summary
The original code had issues with the Gemini API integration, showing errors like "models/gemini is not found for API version v1beta" when users entered "gemini" as the model name, instead of the proper "gemini-pro" model name.

Additionally, the command parsing logic was simplistic and couldn't handle spaces or quoted arguments properly, potentially breaking command execution.

## Changes Made

### 1. Gemini API Improvements
- Added automatic correction of model names
  - "gemini" → "gemini-pro"
  - "gemini-1.5" → "gemini-1.5-pro"
- Fixed URL construction using proper URI class to avoid deprecation warnings
- Improved error handling for API requests
- Enhanced response parsing to handle various Gemini API response formats

### 2. Command Parsing Enhancements
- Implemented a robust `parseCommand` method in `SystemExecutor.java`
  - Properly handles quoted arguments (both single and double quotes)
  - Manages spaces in command arguments
  - Processes escape characters correctly
- Added `executeCommandString` method for easier command execution
- Improved handling of empty commands to avoid errors

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with new feature information
- Added Gemini API usage instructions to USAGE.md
- Created a CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes

### 4. Testing
- Added unit tests for command parsing with various scenarios
- Added tests for the AIHandler class to verify provider selection and model handling
- All tests pass successfully in the build

## How to Use
The changes are transparent to users, but they should know:
1. When entering "gemini" as model name, the system will automatically use "gemini-pro"
2. Commands with quoted arguments or spaces will be parsed correctly
3. Error messages for API issues are now more descriptive and helpful

These improvements make the System-Aware AI CLI Assistant more robust and user-friendly, especially when working with Google's Gemini API.
